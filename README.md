### cycleTracker is a data visualization/simulation of Citi bike rides over the course of a day in NYC. 

The app was built by [Jacob Feinberg](https://github.com/JTFeinberg) and [Nabil Yafai](https://github.com/Na-Ya) using the D3.js library, Mapbox api, and Express. This was implemented by creating a canvas overlay on the map plotting start and ending coordinates of each bike ride. With d3 transitions each bike ride is shown beginning at the starting location and transitioning toward the ending location. There are options to view the data/simulation by gender, or age demographics. You can also toggle the ‘most popular bike’ to see the bike that was used the most that day.
